# Interlacer

Quick python script I threw up that adds black bars over a picture to mimmic a Interlaced Video.

Saw a video about the effect of CRTs on the look of retro games, This aint a good CRT filter, its just something to extperiment with the trippy effects of Interlaced Video with.

## You will need Python and some libraries to run it

```
sudo pacman -S python python-pip
```

In a python environment
```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Change the the video_path variable to your desired video on line 18.

Run the script
```
python Interlaced-ver1.py 
```

And it should spit the video out.
